1. What are the three countries that generated the highest total profit for Global Superstore in 2014?
For each of these three countries, find the three products with the highest total profit. Specifically, 
what are the products’ names and the total profit for each product?
Global Superstore is a multinational retail company that sells a variety of products across different regions 
and markets. In 2014, the company reported a total profit of $566,152K, However, not all countries 
contributed equally to this profit margin. In fact, only three countries accounted for more than half of the 
total profit generated by Global Superstore in 2014. These countries were:
United States: The United States was the largest and most profitable market for Global Superstore, with a 
total profit of $286.397.72.
India: India was the second most profitable country for Global Superstore, with a total profit of $129,072.68. 
China: China was the third most profitable country for Global Superstore, with a total profit of $150,683.99.

We compared the profit margins of three categories: technology, office supplies, and furniture, across three 
countries: the United States of America, India, and China.
According to our analysis, the United States of America has the highest profit margin in technology 
products, with a total profit of approximately 54.21% of the sales. The second most profitable category is 
office supplies, with a total profit of 42.56% of the sales. The third most profitable category is furniture, 
with a total profit of 3.23% of the sales.
In India, the most profitable category is furniture, with a total profit of around 38% of the sales. The second 
most profitable category is office supplies, with a total profit of 36% of the sales. The third most profitable 
category is technology, with a total profit of 25% of the sales.
In China, the most profitable category is technology, with a total profit of 46% of the sales. The second 
most profitable category is office supplies, with a total profit of 27% of the sales. The third most profitable 
category is furniture, with a total profit of 26% of the sales.
Our analysis suggests that technology products are generally more profitable than office supplies and 
furniture products, except in India where furniture products have a higher profit margin. We also observe 
that there are significant variations in the profitability of different categories across different countries, 
which may indicate different market preferences and demands.

Question 2.
a) Identify the 3 subcategories with the highest average shipping cost in the United States.
One of the factors that affect the profitability of a business is the shipping cost of its products. Here, we 
examined the shipping cost trends of three subcategories of products: tables, copiers, and machines, in the 
United States from 2011 to 2014. We will also focus on the year 2014 as a case study to compare the 
shipping costs of these subcategories.
According to our data, tables had the highest average shipping cost among the three subcategories from 
2011 to 2014, with an average of $70 per order. Copiers came second with an average of $165 per order, 
and machines came third with an average of $132 per order. These figures suggest that tables are more 
expensive to ship than copiers and machines, possibly due to their size, weight, and fragility.
However, when we look at the year 2014 alone, we see a different picture. Copiers had the highest average 
shipping cost in 2014, with an average of $161 per order. Machines came second with an average of $115 
per order, and tables came third with an average of $67 per order. This indicates that copiers and machines 
became more costly to ship in 2014 than in previous years, perhaps due to increased demand, scarcity, or 
inflation.

Question 3.
a) Assess Nigeria’s profitability (i.e., total profit) for 2014. How does it compare to other African
Countries?
!.[.](Profit_by_Arican_contries.jpeg)
b) What factors might be responsible for Nigeria’s poor performance? You might want to investigate
Shipping costs and the average discount as potential root causes.
The chart above shows the profit of different African countries in 2014. We can see that most of the 
countries had a positive profit, while only three of them had a negative profit. The highest positive profit 
was achieved by South Africa, with 9.3k, followed by Morocco, Egypt, and the Democratic Republic of
Congo. Senegal, Algeria, Tanzania, Ghana, Sudan, Cote d'Ivoire, and Mozambique also had positive 
profits, but lower than the top four. On the other hand, the lowest negative profit was recorded by Nigeria, 
with -23k, followed by Zimbabwe and Uganda. These three countries were underperforming compared to 
the rest of the continent.
We examined the reasons for Nigeria's low performance and looked at the different categories, 
subcategories and states. Our findings show that the technology category is lagging behind and that phones 
are not profitable in Nigeria, especially in Niger state. We suggest that the Global Store should diversify its 
product offerings based on the demand in each state and enhance the quality and promotion of the phones.

Question 4.
a) Identify the product subcategory that is the least profitable in Southeast Asia.
Note: For this question, assume that Southeast Asia comprises Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar
(Burma), the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.
b) Is there a specific country i n Southeast Asia where Global Superstore should stop offering the
subcategory identified in 4a?
Based on our analysis product subcategories in Southeast Asia envelopes, supplies, labels, and fasteners 
are the least profitable, but still generate positive profits. However, tables are the only product subcategory 
that has a negative profit of around -64K. This indicates that tables are underperforming in this region and 
need to be addressed.
Indonesia has the highest negative table profit of around -10K, followed by the Philippines, Thailand, and 
Vietnam with -3K each. Myanmar is the only country where almost all products are underperforming, but 
tables have a relatively low negative profit of around -1K. This suggests that there are different factors 
affecting the table sales in each country, such as demand, competition, pricing, and quality. Global stores
should consider stopping providing tables in Indonesia

Question 5.
a) Which city is the least profitable (in terms of average profit) in the United States? For this analysis,
Discard the cities with less than 10 Orders. b) Why is this city’s average profit so low?
Figure 8 USA cities underperforming in terms of average profit
The chart above shows the average profit of different cities in the USA. It is clear that more than 10 cities 
are underperforming and have a negative average profit. The worst performers are Charlotte, Philadelphia, and Concord, with average profits of -170, -345 and -1862 respectively. This raises the question: why is 
Concord's average profit so low compared to the other cities? One possible explanation is that Concord has 
a high cost of doing business, such as taxes, rent, wages, etc. Another possibility is that Concord has a low 
demand for the products or services offered by the businesses, due to factors such as competition, customer 
preferences, market saturation, etc. A third possibility is that Concord has a poor quality of management, 
such as inefficient operations, ineffective marketing, lack of innovation, etc. These are some of the potential 
reasons that could account for Concord's dismal performance in terms of profit.

Question 6.
a) Which product subcategory has the highest average profit in Australia?
Figure 9 Average profit by sub-category in Australia
The subcategory products that generate the most profit in Australia are appliances, copiers and phones, 
according to the chart above. These products have an average profit of $139, $105 and $99 per unit, 
respectively, which are significantly higher than the other subcategories
